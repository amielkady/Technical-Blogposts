        <h1>iPhone Died While Updating (What Happens? What to Do?)</h1>

    <p>Updating your iPhone can be a tedious process. Not only does it require additional space, but many users experience issues with their devices with each new iOS. Some users even say their iPhone died while updating. So, what should you do when facing this situation?</p>
    <p>iPhones are known for their high-quality batteries. If you’ve been using your phone well, chances are the battery life will still be over 90% after years.</p>
    <p>Yet, the iOS update can still drain the battery. More often than not, you can simply charge your phone, and the update will pick up where it left off.</p>
    <p>If that doesn’t happen, you might need to check out the other solutions we have in this article. So, keep reading to find the answers to all your questions.</p>
    
    <h2>What Happens When iPhone Dies During an Update</h2>
    <p>Usually, your phone dying during an update isn’t cause for concern. After all, a software update is a heavy process that can take a long time, especially if you haven’t updated your phone in a while.</p>
    <p>If your iPhone died during an update, when you turn it back on, it’d just pick up the update process where it left off. However, some things might go wrong.</p>
    <p>For instance, the files that are necessary for your phone to turn on might not have been updated properly, causing your phone to not turn on. So, your iPhone might be bricked.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the iPhone update process requires your phone’s battery to be over 50%. That’s why if your iPhone dies during an update, it might be indicative of battery issues.</p>
    <p>The thing is, your iPhone might not have died at all. The problem might be that your phone ran out of storage, so the software can’t be installed.</p>
    
    <h2>What to Do if iPhone Died While Updating</h2>
    <p>If your iPhone died during an update, simply leaving it to charge for a while and then turning it back on will do the trick. However, if your phone dies during a critical part of the update, it might need more work. There are multiple solutions to this problem.</p>
    
    <h3>Charge Your iPhone</h3>
    <p>The first solution to a dead phone is to recharge it! The hard part about charging your iPhone when it’s already dead is you won’t know whether or not it’s charging. That’s why you should leave your phone plugged in for over an hour.</p>
    <p>After the iPhone charges, it should turn on and resume the update. If that’s not the case, proceed with the following solutions.</p>
    
    <h3>Force Restart</h3>
    <p>Usually, you can restart your iPhone by holding the power button, but forcing a restart is a little different. The reason is that a force restart operates at a hardware level. To force restart your phone, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quickly press and release the volume up button.</li>
        <li>Then press and release the volume down button.</li>
        <li>Press the power button until the Apple logo shows on the screen.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Recovery Mode</h3>
    <p>Recovery mode is a lifesaver for iPhone users. It basically allows you to access your phone from your Macbook. The downside is you have to own a Macbook and have the latest version of iTunes on both devices.</p>
    <p>To enter recovery mode, follow these simple steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Connect your charged iPhone to your Macbook, then open iTunes.</li>
        <li>If iTunes is already open, you might need to close it and then open it again.</li>
        <li>The recovery mode screen should appear on your phone; if it doesn’t appear, force restart your phone.</li>
        <li>Then, you should locate your iPhone on the computer.</li>
        <li>Once you find the iPhone, simply click update to finish the update process.</li>
        <li>In some cases, the download might take a long time, so your phone might exit recovery mode. Simply follow the steps again without unplugging your phone.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to Avoid Your iPhone Dying During Updates</h2>
    <p>If you’re about to update your iPhone, there are some things you should consider to keep your phone from dying during the long update process.</p>
    
    <h3>Charge Your iPhone Before Updating</h3>
    <p>The simplest way to avoid your iPhone dying is to charge it. Though your device can undergo an update when the battery is over 50%, it’s best to fully charge your phone.</p>
    
    <h3>Keep Your Phone Charging During the Update</h3>
    <p>Since the iPhone's software update can easily drain the battery, you can just keep your phone plugged into the charger while it updates.</p>
    <p>However, you should keep an eye on your phone. That’s because your phone can overheat both from charging and updating at the same time. So, check your phone every couple of minutes to ensure it doesn’t get too warm.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><strong>What to do if iPhone died while updating?</strong></p>
    <p>Having your phone die during an update can be scary. Most times, though, it’s no cause for concern. In fact, once you charge your phone and turn it on, it’ll likely continue the update process.</p>
    <p>If that doesn’t happen, you can force restart your phone or enter recovery mode and continue the update process through your laptop.</p>

    <h1>Why Is Your Tesla Not Receiving Updates?</h1>
    <p>Just like any electronic device, your Tesla needs software updates to fix unwanted bugs and get new features. Typically, Tesla sends out updates to its users every month, and sometimes they send minor updates to fix some small issues.</p>
    <p>Is your Tesla not receiving updates? Well, that can be an annoying problem.</p>
    <p>Luckily, we have some solutions to fix this issue for you, so you can receive Tesla updates and enjoy new features. So stick around to find out everything you need to know.</p>
    
    <h2>Tesla Not Receiving Updates</h2>
    <p>Here’s a list of some of the most common reasons why your Tesla isn’t receiving updates:</p>
    
    <h3>Not Connected to The Internet</h3>
    <p>It goes without saying that your Tesla requires a working internet connection to download the update. So, the first thing you need to check is the internet connection.</p>
    <p>Make sure you’re in the range of the wireless router, and that the connection is active and working. You can do that by connecting another device, like your mobile phone, to the same connection and checking if it’s working.</p>
    <p>If your internet connection isn’t working, you need to fix it or find another internet connection to download the updates.</p>
    
    <h3>Reboot Touchscreen</h3>
    <p>In some cases, rebooting the touchscreen can solve the issue. You can do that by proceeding with the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, shift the car into Park.</li>
        <li>Then, on the touchscreen, choose the “Controls” option, and go to Safety.</li>
        <li>Select the “Power Off” option and wait for at least two minutes without interacting with the Tesla.</li>
        <li>Finally, press the brakes or open a door to wake the vehicle up.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Update Isn’t for Your Car</h3>
    <p>Have you heard other Tesla owners speaking about a recent update? Well, Tesla has produced many models, and each model gets its own updates.</p>
    <p>In other words, this update might not be for your model or your car configuration. So, if you’ve checked for the latest updates on your Tesla and didn’t find any, there’s nothing to worry about.</p>
    
    <h3>New Cars Don’t Immediately Receive Updates</h3>
    <p>Unlike a new phone, you won’t find a notification for new updates to install on your new Tesla. New cars can take around two weeks before they start receiving software updates.</p>
    
    <h3>Submit a Service Ticket</h3>
    <p>If none of the previous solutions could fix the problem, you can simply submit a service ticket to Tesla and get your car checked out.</p>
    <p>You can do that by opening the Tesla app on your phone and going to the “Service” option. Then, select “Upgrades And Accessories” and submit a ticket about your issue.</p>
    <p>If there’s any kind of problem with your car, Tesla will surely help you and send these updates to you.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><strong>So, why is your Tesla not receiving updates?</strong></p>
    <p>That can simply be because it’s not connected to an active internet connection. That’s the first thing you should check. After that, you can reboot the touchscreen and check again for software updates.</p>
    <p>You need to keep in mind that updates roll out for different models, so maybe your car is still to receive the update. Additionally, new Teslas don’t receive updates immediately.</p>
    <p>You can also submit a service ticket to Tesla if none of these solutions were helpful. Hopefully, you’ll receive updates on your Tesla once more.</p>

    <h1>Why Is My Roku TV Volume so Low?</h1>
    <p>One of the most common issues you can come across with your Roku TV is its volume. It might not turn up, it might suddenly be muted, or no matter how loud the volume is, you might still not hear anything.</p>
    <p>So, why is my Roku TV volume so low? Read on to know what might have caused this and how to fix it.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Is My Roku TV Volume so Low?</h2>
    <p>If you’ve tried turning the volume up and you still can’t hear a thing, you might want to check the following:</p>

    <h3>Remote Pairing Issue</h3>
    <p>A reason your Roku TV volume might be too low and won’t seem to be fixed is simply that the remote isn’t paired.</p>
    <p>Roku remotes can either be standard infrared or enhanced “point-anywhere” remotes. To know which one you have, open the battery compartment and locate the pairing button. If it’s there, then you have an enhanced remote.</p>
    <p>If you have an IR remote, make sure the batteries are fresh and properly inserted, and that nothing is blocking its path to the TV.</p>
    <p>If you have a new enhanced remote, then you’ll first need to set it up. This can be done by accessing Settings > Remote and Devices > Remotes. Then, select your remote and set it up. The TV should start playing music then.</p>
    <p>If your remote isn’t new and was working beforehand, you might need to re-pair it with the TV. To do this, you’ll need to remove the batteries from the remote and unplug your TV for a few seconds.</p>
    <p>Reconnect your TV and turn it on, then put the batteries back in the remote. After that, press the pairing button inside the remote’s battery compartment.</p>
    <p>The pairing light on your remote should start flashing. This means that your remote is paired successfully to the TV.</p>

    <h3>Volume Leveling / Night Volume</h3>
    <p>Volume leveling is a great option that allows for more consistent sound levels across different media. It solves the issue of loud commercials in between otherwise quiet shows. This way, you won’t need to keep adjusting the volume.</p>
    <p>Night volume, on the other hand, softens some exaggerated sounds while enhancing others. This technology is available on many Roku devices. Turning it on might help with your audio issues. To turn it off or on, simply press the star (*) button on your remote control and switch modes.</p>

    <h3>Audio Settings</h3>
    <p>Many TVs come with different audio modes that enhance your viewing experience. However, they’re not specifically assigned to any content. You’ll need to manually adjust these modes to match your preferences.</p>
    <p>You might also need to adjust bass, mids, and treble frequencies. All these options might seem insignificant, but fine-tuning them will dramatically enhance your experience.</p>
    <p>To adjust audio settings, press the home button, then Settings > Audio. From there, you can make selections to adjust the sound.</p>
    <p>It’s recommended to download the Roku mobile app. This will help you adjust the sound as you like without any complications.</p>

    <h3>External Speaker Issue</h3>
    <p>The audio problem might not be with your Roku TV at all. If you have an external speaker system, it’s best to check it first before making any unnecessary adjustments to your TV.</p>
    <p>Make sure any audio device connected to your Roku TV supports S/PDIF or HDMI audio.</p>
    <p>All Roku TV devices support systems that use digital audio output, sometimes referred to as S/PDIF. To connect this sound system, you’ll use what’s known as a TOSLINK cable.</p>
    <p>The connection that’s often found on newer audio devices is HDMI ARC. To connect it, you simply use the HDMI cable.</p>
    <p>There are even newer devices that use enhanced ARC. This is only available for select Roku TV models.</p>
    <p>Once your audio device is properly connected, you’ll need to enable it from the TV settings. Access the settings from the home menu, select System > Control Other Devices, then highlight ARC from the scroll menu and press ‘OK.’</p>
    <p>You’ll also need to enable a feature called CEC. To access this, instead of highlighting ARC in the previous steps, highlight System audio control, press ‘OK’ to enable it, then highlight 1-touch play, and press ‘OK.’</p>

    <h3>Factory Reset</h3>
    <p>If none of the above options work, you should try resetting your TV to factory mode. This erases any changes that have been made to your TV and resets it to how it was when you first started using it.</p>
    <p>This will erase all your settings and account from the device, so make sure you’ve tried all the other steps before resorting to it.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to do this. You can access the settings menu > System > Advanced System Settings > Advanced Reset, then follow the instructions.</p>
    <p>The second way is to locate the reset button on your Roku TV. It’s usually found on the back or the bottom of the device. You might need a paperclip if it’s a pinhole button. Firmly press the button, then wait 10 seconds.</p>
    <p>The TV’s light will blink rapidly, indicating that the reset is done.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Your Roku TV volume might be too low due to an unpaired remote, improper sound settings, or a faulty audio connection.</p>
    <p>If you’re using an external audio device, make sure it’s properly connected and that its volume is turned on.</p>
    <p>If the issue is none of these, then you might want to factory reset your device. This last resort will surely solve your problem.</p>
